/*
    Write a function to represent Floyd Triangle, given input is the number of rows of the Floyd triangle
    Example if the number of rows is 3
    Result:
    1
    2 3
    4 5 6





    2 Write a  program to print all permutations of a given String. For example, if given String is "GOD" then your program should print all 6 permutations of this string, 
    e.g. "GOD," "OGD," "DOG," "GDO," "ODG," and "DGO."

    

    *write a function that checks if two provided strings are anagrams of each other; letter casing shouldnâ€™t matter. Also, consider only characters, not spaces or punctuation. For example
    anagram('finder', 'Friend')  --> true
    anagram('hello', 'bye') --> false
